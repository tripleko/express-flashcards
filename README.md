This is a toy project I made to scratch my itch. I guarantee it has bugs and terrible design choices that will eventually explode in your face (in fact, I'm keenly aware of a number of flaws that I haven't got around to fixing). As such, **I do not recommend anyone (other than myself) actually use this project.**

Single user flashcard app designed specifically for programming related cards - intended primarily for localhost use. Create flashcards with markdown and enjoy the nice syntax highlighting and formatting courtesy of Codemirror + highlight.js + MathJax.

Bring your own database: add an .env file or environment variable for MONGODB_URI. I'm just using something local but mlab works too.
